**A function is a relationship between inputs and outputs. It describes how an input is transformed into an output.** Understanding this is essential for software developers.

Many developers tend to think of functions as just reusable blocks of code. Even while writing this article, GitHub Copilot suggested the following definition of a function: "A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task". However, functions are not about code reuse. They are about defining relationships between a program’s inputs and its outputs. A function describes what transformations you need to apply to input values to get the desired output value.

Code reuse isn’t the main purpose of functions. It’s a consequence of how functions behave. Their primary purpose is to define how a specific set of inputs produces a desired output.
