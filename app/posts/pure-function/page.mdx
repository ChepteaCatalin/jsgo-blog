**Disclaimer:** I am not an expert in functional programming. I only have limited experience with FP concepts in JavaScript.

When you ask developers what a pure function is, you often get answers like “A function that always returns the same output for the same input”. While this is technically correct, it’s just a part of the truth, an oversimplification that can lead to misunderstandings.

If you check the definition on Wikipedia, you’ll find a [more comprehensive explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). It adds that a pure function must also have **no side effects**.

I had an argument with one interviewer on this concept. He’s the kind of guy (Techinal Architect) who thinks that having worked 10+ years in his position means he knows everything. He insisted that a function returning the same output for the same input is the only requirement for being a pure function. I disagreed, explaining that this definition misses a crucial aspect: side effects.

I told him that I can write a function that returns the sum of two numbers but also modifies a `localStorage` value that is used elsewhere in the program:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  localStorage.setItem('very-important-data', Math.random()); // <-- side effect

  return a + b;
}
```

According to his definition, this function is pure. But, in reality this function alters the state of the application, making it impure.

He mumbled something that I don't remember. I failed that job interview. Anyways, it was a bad company. F*ck them!

If you are ever asked what a pure function is, say that **a pure function is one that has referential transparency**.

**Referential transparency** is a property that allows you to replace a function call with its resulting value without changing the program's behavior. Practically, this means that if you go to every place where the function is called and replace the call with its result, and the app still works as before, then the function has referential transparency and is pure. This way, you satisfy the 2 conditions of the pure functions:

1. return values are identical for identical arguments
2. has NO side effects

What about a function that has a side effect, but this side effect isn't ever observed or relied upon anywhere else in the program? Does that function still have referential transparency? The answer is YES, the function is still referential transparent, because who the f*ck cares about something that is not happening?

## Are impurities bad?

Ansolutely not!

**A program without side effects is useless.** At some point, you need to change the DOM, write to a database, make network requests, read user input, and so on. All of these operations are side effects.

**A program without side effects is also impossible to create.** At some point, it must interact with the outside world, which inherently involves side effects. Even reading from or writing to memory, consuming CPU cycles and power, or emitting heat as a result of your program’s execution already makes it impure.

So, **function purity is a utopia**. Strive for it, but accept that you will never fully reach it. Use pure functions where they bring practical benefits. If you find yourself overengineering just to maintain purity, then pure functions may not be necessary in your context.
